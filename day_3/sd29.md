# Study Drills for Exercise 29

1. What do you think the `if` does to the code under it?

The `if` makes the code below it only run if the conditional statement after `if` is true.

2. Why does the code under the `if` need to be indented two spaces?

Like the `.each` method, the `if` has a block underneath it and indenting the block helps to organize the code so it's easier to read.

3. What happens if it isn't indented?

The code seems to still run but it will be much more difficult to come back to and understand if it isn't properly formatted.

4. Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the `if-statement`? Try it

I tried

```
a = 4
if a != 5
 puts "That's not 5!"
end
```

and it printed the statement.

5. What happens if you change the initial values for `people`, `cats`, and `dogs`?

What is printed could be changed because the values of the inequalities could be changed.
