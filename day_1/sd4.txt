The (NameError) means that Ruby was looking a variable or method that didn't
exist as the name it was looking for. In this case, carpool_capacity was
probably misspelled in either line 7 where it was defined, or when it was called
in line 14.

1) In this case it isn't necessary to use 4.0 for space_in_a_car because it is
only used to calculate carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car = 4 * 30
which is 120. Because the product of two integers is an integer, we don't need
to use floats.
